# Preface {-}

This book is about checking data with the
[validate](https://cran.r-project.org/package=validate) package for
[R](https://www.r-project.org). 

This version of the book was rendered with `validate` version 
`r packageVersion("validate")`.  The latest release of `validate` can be installed
from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) as follows.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("validate")
```

The purpose of this book is to give examples of common data validation tasks,
to demonstrate the main tools and workflows of the `validate` package, and to
show how to analyze data validation results.

The book is organized as follows. Chapter \@ref(sect:intro) discusses the
bare necessities to be able to follow the rest of the book. Chapters \@ref(sect:varlevelchecks)
to \@ref(sect:statisticalchecks) form the 'cookbook' part of the book and discuss
many different ways to check your data by example. Chapter \@ref(sect:indicators)
is devoted to deriving plausibility measures with the `validate` package.

The first Chapter gives a short overview of the `validate` package workflow.
The next Chapters treat collections of validation tasks of increasing
complexity, mostly by example. Chapters \@ref(sect:work) and
\@ref(sect:rulefiles) treat working with validate in-depth. In \@ref(sect:work)
an extensive overview of functionality of the validate package is described.
\@ref(sect:rulefiles) provides more details and options on working with rules
stored in text files while \@ref(sect:comparing) discusses how to compare two
or more versions of a dataset, possibly automated through the
[lumberjack](https://cran.r-project.org/package=lumberjack) package.  The
section with Biblographical Notes lists some references and points out some
literature for further reading.
